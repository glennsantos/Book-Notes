Delivery Lead Time + Deployment Frequency = Quantity Metrics (Tempo)

Time to Restore Service + Change Fail Rate = Quality Metrics (Stability)

## Delivery Lead Time
> the time it takes to go from code committed to code successfully running in production
> Shorter is better
> measurement: from < 1 hour to more than six months


## Deployment Frequency 
a software deployment to production or to an app store.
> measurement: from on demand to fewer than once every six months

## Mean Time to Restore (MTTR))
> How quickly can service be restored?
> measurement: from < 1 hour to more than six months

## Change Failure Rate (CFR)
> percentage of changes for the primary application or service they work on either result in degraded service or subsequently require remediation 


----

High Performers
> On demand deployment frequency
> Less than one hour deliver lead time
> MTTR: < 1 hour
> CFR: 0 - 15%

there is no tradeoff between improving performance and achieving higher levels of stability and quality

## Delivery Performance Impact on Org Performance

> high-performing organizations were consistently twice as likely to exceed these goals as low performers.
> high performers were also twice as likely to exceed objectives in quantity of goods and services, operating efficiency, customer satisfaction, quality of products or services, and achieving organization or mission goals.

delivery performance matters provides a strong argument against outsourcing the development of software that is strategic to your business

*In organizations with a learning culture, they are incredibly powerful.*
