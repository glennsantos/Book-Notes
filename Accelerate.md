Delivery Lead Time + Deployment Frequency = Quantity Metrics (Tempo)

Time to Restore Service + Change Fail Rate = Quality Metrics (Stability)

## Delivery Lead Time
> the time it takes to go from code committed to code successfully running in production
> Shorter is better
> measurement: from < 1 hour to more than six months


## Deployment Frequency 
a software deployment to production or to an app store.
> measurement: from on demand to fewer than once every six months

## Time to Restore Service
> How quickly can service be restored?
> measurement: from < 1 hour to more than six months

## Change Fail Rate
