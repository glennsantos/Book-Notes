Anchor habits to your identity to make it stick in the long term.

Habits also influence your identity as a person.

Doing leads to being because you gain evidence that you are that kind of "doer"

To build a habit
1. Decide what type of person you want to be
2. Prove it to yourself with small wins

PS: this is why BJ Fogg's method didn't work: you had extrinsic rewards instead of intrinsic aka change of identity.

Habits solve problems with the least energy and effort.

1st Law: Make it obvious (or invisible to break habit)
2nd Law: Make it attractive (or unattractive to break habit)
3rd Law: Make it easy (or difficult to break habit)
4th Law: Make it satisfying (or unsatisfying to break habit)

Use Habit Scorecard to surface all habits.
- Rate based on how the habit helps you become your ideal person.

----

Cue > Craving > Response > Reward

Make an implementation initiation to make sure you do the habit at a specific TIME and PLACE

Habit stack:
- chain a new habit onto an existing one
- need to be SPECIFIC in the trigger
- create OBVIOUS VISUAL cues

Its easier to associate a new habit with a new context

One Space, One Use
- if space it as a premium, do "one item, one use" instead

----

If you want behaviors that are stable and predictable, you need an environment that is stable and predictable.

disciplined environment > disciplined person

you can break a habit but you are unlikely to forget it.

----

Add supernormal stimuli to make habits attractive.

Dopamine is released both during experiencing pleasure and anticipating it.

Temptation Bundling
- action you want to do + action you need to do

Premack's Principle
> more probable behaviors will reinforce less probable behaviors

----

Those CLOSEST to us affect our habits the most. (friends and family)
> Join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior AND has something common you desire

Those in the MAJORITY affect our habits (community)
> we go with what the group wants, over our own path

Those in POWER affect our habits (leaders)
> mimicking them transfers some of their prestige and authority to us

----

Emotions drive the ability to make decisions. Thus, losing emotions causes loss in will to act.

Switch mindset from HAVING to do things >> GETTING to do things

Highlight benefits and not drawbacks.

Create a motivation ritual.
- stack a routine before an enjoyable experience
- move that stack before a habit you want to do, to hijack the positive emotions of the routine

----

The most effective form of learning is practice, not planning.

Motion: does not produce output. Planning, etc
Action: produces output

Automaticity
The key is to start with repetition not perfection.

Frequency not time creates habits.

----

Use addition by subtraction to reduce cognitive and other effort to building a habit.

The central idea is to create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible.

----

We will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work.

Prime your environment
> Set it up so that actions are easy to do.
> Or set it up so that bad habits are hard to do.

----

2 Minute Rule:
> new habit needs only two minutes to do

Standardize before you optimize.

----

Commitment device
> Use it to lock in better behavior

----

Positive emotions cultivate habits. 
Negative emotions destroy them.

What is immediately rewarded is repeated. 
What is immediately punished is avoided.

You want the ending of your habit to be satisfying. 

Incentives can start a habit. 
Identity sustains a habit.

To get a habit to stick you need to feel immediately successful—even if it’s in a small way.

----

Habit tracking
> Automate habit tracking
> If not, make tracking very easy
> Manually track only most important habits
> Record immediately after accomplishment

> Don't break the chain
> Never miss twice
> Or do the minimum to avoid losing the streak

----

If a failure is painful, it gets fixed. 
If a failure is relatively painless, it gets ignored.

The more immediate and more costly a mistake is, the faster you will learn from it.

Behavior only shifts if the punishment is painful enough and reliably enforced.

In general, the more 
- local, 
- tangible, 
- concrete, and 
- immediate the consequence, 
the more likely it is to influence individual behavior.

Habit Contract
- a verbal or written agreement in which you state your commitment to a particular habit and the punishment that will occur if you don’t follow through.
- find one or two people to act as your accountability partners and sign off on the contract with you.

Knowing that someone is watching can be a powerful motivator.

explore/exploit trade-off.

When you can’t win by being better, you can win by being different. 
> By combining your skills, you reduce the level of competition
> Play a game that favors your strengths. If you can’t find a game that favors you, create one.

Our genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. 
They tell us what to work hard on. 

Work hard on the things that come easy.

Choose the habits that best suit you.

----

Goldilocks Zone
- work on projects with manageable difficulty.
- 4% beyong your current ability

Behaviors need to remain novel in order for them to stay attractive and satisfying.

The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom.

The sweet spot of desire occurs at a 50/50 split between success and failure

Professionals stick to the schedule.
Amateurs let life get in the way.

Professionals take action even when the mood isn't right.

----

habits are the backbone of any pursuit of excellence.
> as a habit becomes automatic, you become less sensitive to feedback.
> stop paying attention to little errors. 

Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery

Establish a system for reflection and review.

Reflection and review enables the long-term improvement of all habits because it makes you aware of your mistakes and helps you consider possible paths for improvement.

keep a “decision journal” in which they record the major decisions they make each week, why they made them, and what they expect the outcome to be.

1. What went well this year?
2. What didn’t go so well this year?
3. What did I learn?

My yearly Integrity Report answers three questions:
1. What are the core values that drive my life and work?
2. How am I living and working with integrity right now?
3. How can I set a higher standard in the future?

They indicate when I should:
⤴️ upgrade my habits and take on new challenges 
and when I should 
🎛️ dial my efforts back and focus on the fundamentals.

The more sacred an idea is to us—that is, the more deeply it is tied to our identity—the more strongly we will defend it against criticism.

keep your identity small.

When you cling too tightly to one identity, you become brittle.
> your identity works with the changing circumstances rather than against them.

periodically check in to see if your old habits and beliefs are still serving you.

----

Success is not a goal to reach or a finish line to cross. It is a system to improve, an endless process to refine. 

Tiny changes. 
Remarkable results.

----

Awareness comes before desire.
Happiness is simply the absence of desire. 
> Happiness is the space between one desire being fulfilled and a new desire forming.

It is the idea of pleasure that we chase.

Peace occurs when you don’t turn your observations into problems.

With a big enough why you can overcome any how.

Being curious is better than being smart. 

Emotions drive behavior.
> The feeling comes first, and then the behavior.

We can only be rational and logical after we have been emotional.

Your response tends to follow your emotions.
> most people believe that the reasonable response is the one that benefits them

Suffering drives progress. 

Your actions reveal how badly you want something.

Reward is on the other side of sacrifice. 

Self-control is difficult because it is not satisfying. 
> Resisting temptation does not satisfy your craving; it just ignores it. 

Our expectations determine our satisfaction.

Satisfaction = Liking – Wanting
> You’re perpetually putting more weight on the problem than the solution.

The pain of failure correlates to the height of expectation. 
> Failing to attain something you want hurts more than failing to attain something you didn’t think much about in the first place.

Feelings come both before and after the behavior.
> Cue > Craving (Feeling) > Response > Reward (Feeling)

Desire initiates. Pleasure sustains.

Hope declines with experience and is replaced by acceptance.
> New strategies seem more appealing than old ones because they can have unbounded hope.
