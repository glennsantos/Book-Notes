### eight core expectations of software architects

1. Make architecture decisions
   * define the architecture decisions and design principles
   * An architect should guide rather than specify technology choices.
2. Continually analyze the architecture
   * recommend solutions for improvement
   * holistically analyze changes in technology and problem domains to determine the soundness of the architecture.
3. Keep current with latest trends
   * decisions an architect makes tend to be long-lasting and difficult to change.

4. Ensure compliance with decisions
   * continually verifying that development teams are following the architecture decisions and design principles defined, documented, and communicated by the architect.
   * compliance using automated fitness functions and automated tools.
5. Diverse exposure and experience
   * stretch comfort zone
   * should be aggressive in seeking out opportunities to gain experience in multiple languages, platforms, and technologies.
6. Have business domain knowledge
   *  Without business domain knowledge, it is difficult to design an effective architecture to meet the requirements of the business.
   *  creates a strong level of confidence that the software architect knows what they are doing and is competent to create an effective and correct architecture.
7. Possess interpersonal skills
   * provide technical guidance to the team
   *  lead the development teams through the implementation of the architecture.
8. Understand and navigate politics
   *  almost every decision an architect makes will be challenged
   *   navigate the politics of the company and apply basic negotiation skills to get most decisions approved.

Unknown unknowns are the nemesis of software systems. 
> architects cannot design for unknown unknowns.

**First Law of Software Architecture**
> Everything in software architecture is a trade-off.
*Corollary 1*
> If an architect thinks they have discovered something that isn’t a trade-off, more likely they just haven’t identified the trade-off yet.

**Second Law of Software Architecture:**
> Why is more important than how.
