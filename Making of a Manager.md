## 5 conditions that increase a team’s odds of success: 
1. having a real team (one with clear boundaries and stable membership)
2. a compelling direction
3. an enabling structure
4. a supportive organizational context
5. expert coaching.

*Your role as a manager is not to do the work yourself, even if you are the best at it, because that will only take you so far. Your role is to improve the purpose, people, and process of your team to get as high a multiplier effect on your collective outcome as you can.*

## To be a great manager, answer these...

1. Do I Find It More Motivating to Achieve a Particular Outcome or to Play a Specific Role?
2. Do I Like Talking with People?
3. Can I Provide Stability for an Emotionally Challenging Situation?


*adaptability is a key trait of great managers*
+ their number one priority is making their team successful, and they are willing to adapt to become the leaders that their organizations need.

Manager is a specific role
Leadership is a quality rather than a job.
A leader doesn’t have to be a manager.

Feedback, at its best, transforms people in ways they’re proud of

Types of feedback
1. Set expectations for future work. Usually general feedback based on what works for most people. What success looks like, common pitfalls to avoid
2. Task-specific. Share it quickly and often.
3. Behavioral Feedback. Extracted from themes that emerge from task-specific feedback. Best done in person because it is personal in nature.
4. 360 Feedback. From more than one person, so more complete and objective.

Delayed feedback will make the person think either
* rating is unfair and should have been told to them sooner
* rating is fair but manager didn't know there was a problem until too late
* rating is fair but manager wasn't honest so no room for improvement

Failures will occur, projects will miss deadlines, and people will make mistakes. That’s okay. But when these things happen, readjusting expectations as quickly as possible helps people recover from errors with grace. You demonstrate care and maturity when you preempt bigger issues down the road.

What you intend to say and what the listener hears are not always the same.

Make sure when you give feedback, the listener feels safe:
1. Use positive feedback.
2. Make sure you really care about the person and their future. Communicate this to them well.
3. Ask questions first instead of laying down your opinion directly.
4. Make sure others share your feedback, then ask them to relay it to the person as well.

When giving feedback...
1. Use clear examples that get at the why so it’s easier for the recipient to know what you mean.
2. Be clear about whether you’re setting an expectation or merely offering a suggestion.
3. ask your report, “So what do you think the next steps should be?”

The best way to give critical feedback is to deliver it directly and dispassionately. 
> Plainly say what you perceive the issue to be, what made you feel that way, and how you’d like to work together to resolve the concern.
>  Acknowledge the disagreement respectfully, then move on.

## Managing Large Teams

1. Emphasize that you welcome dissenting opinions and reward those who express them.
2. Own your mistakes and remind your team that you are human, just like everyone else. 
3. Use language that invites discussion
4. You can also ask directly for advice

**Context Switching**
1. scanning through my calendar every morning and preparing for each meeting
2. developing a robust note-taking and task-management system
3. finding pockets for reflection at the end of every week

*You can’t do everything, so you must prioritize.*

Success becomes more and more about mastering a few key skills
* hiring exceptional leaders
* building self-reliant teams
* establishing a clear vision
* communicating well.

## Delegating well

1. Assigning big problems is a sign of trust
   * Tell everyone else that she should now be considered the owner of the problem. Doing so creates accountability, but more important, the public declaration empowers the delegate.
2. see eye to eye on what’s most important
   * it’s unrealistic to expect that you should know all the details of your report’s day-to-day
   * What are the biggest priorities right now for our team?
   * Are we aligned in how we think about people, purpose, and process?

*A manager’s job is to be a positive multiplier for her team.*

### the end goal of management is to get better outcomes. 

*you are constantly looking for ways to replace yourself in the job you are currently doing.*

**Try to double your leadership capacity every year.**

The rule of thumb for delegation goes like this: 
* spend your time and energy on the intersection of:
  1. what’s most important to the organization and 
  2. what you’re uniquely able to do better than anyone else.

Examples
+ Identifying and communicating what matters.
+ Hiring top talent.
+ Resolving conflicts within my group.
