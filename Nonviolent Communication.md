**NVC / Compassionate Communication**
> a way of communicating that leads us to give from the heart. 
> NVC fosters deep listening, respect, and empathy and engenders a mutual desire to give from the heart. 
> may be expressed through silence, a quality of presence, as well as through facial expressions and body language.

Instead of habitual, automatic reactions, our words become conscious responses based firmly on awareness of what we are perceiving, feeling, and wanting. 
> We are led to express ourselves with 
+ honesty and 
+ clarity, while simultaneously paying others a
+ respectful and 
+ empathic attention.

> emphasis on deep listening

When we give from the heart, we do so out of the joy that springs forth whenever we willingly enrich another person’s life.

> stay motivated solely to give and receive compassionately

## The NVC Process
1. Observations - The concrete actions we observe that affect our well-being; remove emotions first
2. Feelings - How we feel in relation to what we observe
3. Needs - The needs, values, desires, etc. that create our feelings. Why am I feeling this way?
4. Requests - The concrete actions we request in order to enrich our lives

Two parts of NVC:
1. Expressing honestly through the four components
2. Receiving empathically through the four components

## Types of Life-alienating communication

**Moralistic Judgments**
> imply wrongness or badness on people who don’t act in harmony with our values

forms of judgment
- Blame, 
- insults, 
- put-downs, 
- labels, 
- criticism, 
- comparisons, and 
- diagnoses.

Our attention is focused on classifying, analyzing, and determining levels of wrongness 
+ rather than on what we and others need and are not getting.

we increase **defensiveness** and **resistance** among the very people whose behaviors are of concern to us
> we will experience the consequences of diminished goodwill on the part of those who comply with our values out of a sense of either external or internal coercion. 
> they are likely to feel **resentment** and **decreased self-esteem** when they respond to us out of fear, guilt, or shame.
> each time others associate us in their minds with any of those feelings, *the likelihood of their responding compassionately to our needs and values in the future decreases.*

value judgments vs moralistic judgments.
> **Value judgments** reflect our beliefs of how life can best be served.
> we make **moralistic judgments** of people and behaviors that fail to support our value judgments
> moralistic judgment is phrased as an absolute when it should be expressed relative to our values.

*Classifying and judging people promotes violence.*

**Comparisons**
> Comparisons are a form of judgment
> blocks compassion, both for oneself and for others.

**Denial of Responsibility** / Amtssprache / “office talk” or “bureaucratese.”
> we are each responsible for our own thoughts, feelings, and actions.
> use of the common expression *have to*, *make me feel*
> Our language obscures awareness of personal responsibility.

we attribute their cause to factors outside ourselves:
- Vague, impersonal forces - "had to"
- Our condition, diagnosis, or personal or psychological history - "I am ..."
- The actions of others - "because..."
- The dictates of authority - "boss told me to"
- Group pressure - "because all my friends did."
- Institutional policies, rules, and regulations - "it’s policy."
- Gender roles, social roles, or age roles - "I am ..."
- Uncontrollable impulses - "made me do it"

We can replace language that implies lack of choice with language that acknowledges choice.

**Desires as demands**
> A demand explicitly or implicitly threatens listeners with blame or punishment if they fail to comply
> use the word *deserve*

We can never make people do anything.

When we are in contact with our feelings and needs, we humans no longer make good slaves and underlings.

**separation of observation from evaluation.**
> evaluations are to be based on observations specific to time and context.
> observing without evaluating is the highest form of human intelligence.
> separate specific observed behavior from personal opinion about those behaviors.

When we combine observation with evaluation, people are apt to hear criticism.

----

the mature person becomes able to differentiate feelings into as many nuances

Expressing our vulnerability can help resolve conflicts.

Distinguish feelings from thoughts.
> feelings are not being clearly expressed when the word **feel** is followed by:
- that, like, as if > I feel as if I'm not important
- I, you, he, she, they, it. > I feel she doesn't understand me
- names or nouns referring to people > I feel Amy isn't up to the task
> Just express the feeling directly. I'm tired and bored.

Distinguish between what we feel and how we think others react or behave toward us.
> they reveal more how we think others are behaving than what we are actually feeling ourselves.

By developing a vocabulary of feelings that allows us to clearly and specifically name or identify our emotions, we can connect more easily with one another.
