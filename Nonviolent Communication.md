**The NVC Process**
1. Observations - The concrete actions we observe that affect our well-being; remove emotions first
2. Feelings - How we feel in relation to what we observe
3. Needs - The needs, values, desires, etc. that create our feelings. Why am I feeling this way?
4. Requests - The concrete actions we request in order to enrich our lives

Two parts of NVC:
1. Expressing honestly through the four components
2. Receiving empathically through the four components
