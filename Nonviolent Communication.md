**NVC / Compassionate Communication**
> a way of communicating that leads us to give from the heart. 
> NVC fosters deep listening, respect, and empathy and engenders a mutual desire to give from the heart. 
> may be expressed through silence, a quality of presence, as well as through facial expressions and body language.

Instead of habitual, automatic reactions, our words become conscious responses based firmly on awareness of what we are perceiving, feeling, and wanting. 
> We are led to express ourselves with 
+ honesty and 
+ clarity, while simultaneously paying others a
+ respectful and 
+ empathic attention.

> emphasis on deep listening

When we give from the heart, we do so out of the joy that springs forth whenever we willingly enrich another person’s life.

> stay motivated solely to give and receive compassionately

## The NVC Process
1. Observations - The concrete actions we observe that affect our well-being; remove emotions first
2. Feelings - How we feel in relation to what we observe
3. Needs - The needs, values, desires, etc. that create our feelings. Why am I feeling this way?
4. Requests - The concrete actions we request in order to enrich our lives

Two parts of NVC:
1. Expressing honestly through the four components
2. Receiving empathically through the four components

## Types of Life-alienating communication

**Moralistic Judgments**
> imply wrongness or badness on people who don’t act in harmony with our values

forms of judgment
- Blame, 
- insults, 
- put-downs, 
- labels, 
- criticism, 
- comparisons, and 
- diagnoses.

Our attention is focused on classifying, analyzing, and determining levels of wrongness 
+ rather than on what we and others need and are not getting.

we increase **defensiveness** and **resistance** among the very people whose behaviors are of concern to us
> we will experience the consequences of diminished goodwill on the part of those who comply with our values out of a sense of either external or internal coercion. 
> they are likely to feel **resentment** and **decreased self-esteem** when they respond to us out of fear, guilt, or shame.
> each time others associate us in their minds with any of those feelings, *the likelihood of their responding compassionately to our needs and values in the future decreases.*

value judgments vs moralistic judgments.
> **Value judgments** reflect our beliefs of how life can best be served.
> we make **moralistic judgments** of people and behaviors that fail to support our value judgments
> moralistic judgment is phrased as an absolute when it should be expressed relative to our values.

*Classifying and judging people promotes violence.*

**Comparisons**
> Comparisons are a form of judgment
> blocks compassion, both for oneself and for others.

**Denial of Responsibility** / Amtssprache / “office talk” or “bureaucratese.”
> we are each responsible for our own thoughts, feelings, and actions.
> use of the common expression *have to*, *make me feel*
> Our language obscures awareness of personal responsibility.

we attribute their cause to factors outside ourselves:
- Vague, impersonal forces - "had to"
- Our condition, diagnosis, or personal or psychological history - "I am ..."
- The actions of others - "because..."
- The dictates of authority - "boss told me to"
- Group pressure - "because all my friends did."
- Institutional policies, rules, and regulations - "it’s policy."
- Gender roles, social roles, or age roles - "I am ..."
- Uncontrollable impulses - "made me do it"

We can replace language that implies lack of choice with language that acknowledges choice.

**Desires as demands**
> A demand explicitly or implicitly threatens listeners with blame or punishment if they fail to comply
> use the word *deserve*

We can never make people do anything.

When we are in contact with our feelings and needs, we humans no longer make good slaves and underlings.

----

**separation of observation from evaluation.**
> evaluations are to be based on observations specific to time and context.
> observing without evaluating is the highest form of human intelligence.
> separate specific observed behavior from personal opinion about those behaviors.

When we combine observation with evaluation, people are apt to hear criticism.

----

the mature person becomes able to differentiate feelings into as many nuances

Expressing our vulnerability can help resolve conflicts.

Distinguish feelings from thoughts.
> feelings are not being clearly expressed when the word **feel** is followed by:
- that, like, as if > I feel as if I'm not important
- I, you, he, she, they, it. > I feel she doesn't understand me
- names or nouns referring to people > I feel Amy isn't up to the task
> Just express the feeling directly. I'm tired and bored.

Distinguish between what we feel and how we think others react or behave toward us.
> they reveal more how we think others are behaving than what we are actually feeling ourselves.

By developing a vocabulary of feelings that allows us to clearly and specifically name or identify our emotions, we can connect more easily with one another.

----

The third component of NVC entails the acknowledgment of the root of our feelings.

What others do may be the stimulus of our feelings, but not the cause.

four options
1. blame ourselves
   - accept the other person’s judgment and blame ourselves.
   - We choose this option at great cost to our self-esteem, for it inclines us toward feelings of guilt, shame, and depression.
2. blame others.
   -  When we receive messages this way, and blame the speaker, we are likely to feel anger.
3. sense our own feelings and needs.
   - By focusing attention on our own feelings and needs, we become conscious that our current feeling of hurt derives from a need for our efforts to be recognized.
4. sense others’ feelings and needs.
   - shine the light of consciousness on the other person’s feelings and needs as they are currently expressed. 
   - We accept responsibility for our feelings, rather than blame other people, by acknowledging our own needs, desires, expectations, values, or thoughts. 

In NVC, however, we would urge this speaker to go a step further by identifying what she is wanting:
> what need, desire, expectation, hope, or value of hers has not been fulfilled?

 common speech patterns that tend to mask accountability for our own feelings:
 - Use of impersonal pronouns such as it and that
 - use of the expression “I feel (an emotion) because … “ followed by a person or personal pronoun other than I
 - Statements that mention only the actions of others

Distinguish between giving from the heart and being motivated by guilt.

Judgments of others are alienated expressions of our own unmet needs.
> If we wish for a compassionate response from others, it is self-defeating to express our needs by interpreting or diagnosing their behavior.

If we express our needs, we have a better chance of getting them met.
> the more directly we can connect our feelings to our own needs, the easier it is for others to respond to us compassionately.

from the moment people begin talking about what they need rather than what’s wrong with one another, the possibility of finding ways to meet everybody’s needs is greatly increased.

some of the basic human needs
- **Autonomy**
- **Celebration**: either achievements or even an end of a life
- **Integrity**: authenticity, creativity, meaning
- **Interdependence**: acceptance, appreciation, empathy
- **Play**
- **Spiritual Communion**: peace, order, harmony
- **Physical Nurturance**: physical needs, safety, health

If we don’t value our needs, others may not either.

## Emotional Slavery to Emotional Liberation
**First stage: Emotional slavery. **We see ourselves responsible for others’ feelings. Drives **guilt**
> This can easily lead us to see the very people who are closest to us as burdens.
**Second stage: The obnoxious stage. **We feel **angry**; we no longer want to be responsible for others’ feelings.
> We are clear what we are not responsible for, but have yet to learn how to be responsible to others in a way that is not emotionally enslaving.
> in the obnoxious stage, we have yet to grasp that emotional liberation entails more than simply asserting our own needs.
> learning to express her needs and risk dealing with the displeasure of others.
**Third stage: Emotional liberation.** We take responsibility for our intentions and actions.
> we respond to the needs of others out of **compassion**, never out of fear, guilt, or shame.
> we are aware that we can never meet our own needs at the expense of others.

The more directly we can connect our feelings to our needs, the easier it is for others to respond compassionately.

----

The objective of NVC is *NOT to change people and their behavior* in order to get our way; 
> it is to **establish relationships based on honesty and empathy** that will eventually fulfill everyone’s needs.
what we would like to request of each other to enrich each of our lives.

*Use **positive language** when making requests.*
> word it in terms of wants, not do not wants
> they might have received a more cooperative response if they had expressed what they did, rather than what they did not, want.

we also want to word our requests in the form of **concrete actions** that others can undertake and to avoid vague, abstract, or ambiguous phrasing. 
> Making requests in clear, positive, concrete action language reveals what we really want.
> people hate thinking. cause sometimes they second guess themselves, leading to inaction.
> Often, the use of vague and abstract language can mask oppressive interpersonal games.
> Vague language contributes to internal confusion.

When we simply express our feelings, it may not be clear to the listener what we want them to do.
> We talk to others or at them without knowing how to engage in a dialogue with them.

We are often not conscious of what we are requesting.

Requests are received as demands when listeners believe that they will be **blamed** or **punished** if they do not comply.
Requests may sound like **demands** when unaccompanied by the **speaker’s feelings and needs**.

*The clearer we are about what we want, the more likely it is that we’ll get it.*
> whenever we say something to another person, we are requesting something in return.

To make sure the message we sent is the message that’s received, **ask the listener to reflect it back**.
> Express appreciation when your listener tries to meet your request for a reflection.
> Empathize with the listener who doesn’t want to reflect back.
> To prevent negative responses, we can explain to people ahead of time why we may sometimes ask them to reflect back our words.
> We make clear that we’re not testing their listening skills, but checking out whether we’ve expressed ourselves clearly.

**Requesting Honesty**

After we express ourselves vulnerably, we often want to know:
1. what the listener is feeling;
2. what the listener is thinking; or
3. whether the listener would be willing to take a particular action

**Making Requests of a Group**
> When we are not clear about the response we’d like, we may initiate unproductive conversations that end up satisfying no one’s needs.
> In a group, much time is wasted when speakers aren’t certain what response they’re wanting.
> we can benefit from developing and promoting “bas-consciousness” in all our interactions.
+ In India, when people have received the response they want in conversations they have initiated, they say “bas“

When the other person hears a demand from us, they see two options: to *submit* or to *rebel*.
> Our requests are received as demands when others believe they will be blamed or punished if they do not comply.
> Either way, the person requesting is perceived as coercive, and the listener’s capacity to respond compassionately to the request is diminished.

To tell if it’s a demand or a request, *observe what the speaker does* if the request is not complied with.
> It’s a demand if the speaker then **criticizes** or **judges**.
> It’s a demand if the speaker then lays a **guilt trip**.

The more we interpret *noncompliance as rejection*, the more likely our requests will be heard as demands.

the more people hear demands, the less they enjoy being around us.

It’s a request if the speaker then **shows empathy** toward the other person’s needs.

We can help others trust that we are requesting, not demanding, by indicating that we would only want them to comply if they can do so willingly.
> the most powerful way to communicate that we are making a genuine request is to empathize with people when they don’t agree to the request.

 Choosing to request rather than demand *does not mean we give up* when someone says no to our request.
 > It does mean that *we don’t engage in persuasion until we have empathized* with what’s preventing the other person from saying yes.

 **Defining Our Objective When Making Requests**

 If our objective is only to change people and their behavior or to get our way, then NVC is NOT an appropriate tool.

*Our objective is a relationship based on honesty and empathy.*

people may still hear a demand
> particularly true when we occupy positions of authority
> OR speaking with those who have had past experiences with coercive authority figures.

When we give people labels, we tend to act in a way that contributes to the very behavior that concerns us, which we then view as further confirmation of our diagnosis.

*When I tell you what I’d like, I’m not saying that you have to do it or I’ll try to make your life miserable.*

**Receiving Empathically**

**Empathy**: emptying our mind and listening with our whole being
> a respectful understanding of what others are experiencing
> occurs only when we have successfully shed all preconceived ideas and judgments about them.
> requires us to focus full attention on the other person’s message. 
> give to others the time and space they need to express themselves fully and to feel understood.

Empathy is NOT
- advising
- educating
- consoling
- sympathizing (feeling their feelings)
- interrogating
- explaining
- correcting

Instead of offering empathy, we tend instead to give advice or reassurance and to explain our own position or feeling.

Ask before offering advice or reassurance.

Intellectual understanding blocks empathy.

The key ingredient of empathy is **presence**

No matter what others say, we only hear what they are:
1. observing
2. feeling
3. needing
4. requesting.

Listen to what people are needing rather than what they are thinking.

we may wish to reflect back by paraphrasing what we have understood.
>  choosing to reflect a message back to the other party is that it offers them time to reflect on what they’ve said and an opportunity to delve deeper into themselves.

questions for paraphrasing
* what others are observing
* how others are feeling and the needs generating their feelings
* what others are requesting

When asking for information, first express our own feelings and needs.
 
 *Of direct questions*
 Though they may appear to be the most direct way to connect with what’s going on within the other person, I’ve found that questions like these are not the safest route to obtain the information we seek. 
 > give speakers the impression that we’re a schoolteacher examining them or a psychotherapist working on a case

Reflect back messages that are emotionally charged.

Paraphrase only when it contributes to greater compassion and understanding.

When we paraphrase, the tone of voice we use is highly important.
> our tone communicates that we’re asking whether we have understood—not claiming that we have understood.
> be prepared for the possibility that the intention behind our paraphrasing will be misinterpreted.

behind all those messages we’ve allowed ourselves to be intimidated by are just individuals with unmet needs appealing to us to contribute to their well-being.

Paraphrasing tends to save, rather than waste, time.

 It is a poignant experience to receive concrete evidence that someone is empathically connected to us.

**Sustaining Empathy**

allow others the opportunity to **fully express themselves** before turning our attention to solutions or requests for relief.
> If we are uncertain as to whether we have stayed long enough in the process, we can always ask, “Is there more that you wanted to say?”

We know a speaker has received adequate empathy when 
1. we sense a release of tension, or 
2. the flow of words comes to a halt.

We need empathy to give empathy.
> listen to what’s going on in ourselves with the same quality of presence and attention that we offer to others.
> stop, breathe, give ourselves empathy
> We can scream—nonviolently.
> third recourse is to physically remove ourselves from the situation

If we are able to speak our pain nakedly without blame, I find that even people in distress are sometimes able to hear our need.

----

It’s harder to empathize with those who appear to possess more power, status, or resources.

*The more we empathize with the other party, the safer we feel.*

In situations of pain, I recommend first getting the empathy necessary to go beyond the thoughts occupying our heads and recognize our deeper needs.

*We “say a lot” by listening for other people’s feelings and needs.*

The ability to offer empathy to people in stressful situations can defuse potential violence.
> After several minutes of my continuing to reflect their feelings, the group became less hostile.

The more I was able to focus my attention on his feelings and needs, the more I saw him as a person full of despair whose needs weren’t being met.

*When we listen for feelings and needs, we no longer see people as monsters.*

It may be difficult to empathize with those who are closest to us.

*Empathizing with someone’s “no” protects us from taking it personally.*

To bring a conversation back to life: interrupt with empathy.
> best time to interrupt is when we’ve heard one word more than we want to hear.
> People are not aware that empathy is often what they are needing.
> What bores the listener bores the speaker too.
> Speakers prefer that listeners interrupt rather than pretend to listen.
> All of us want our words to enrich others, not to burden them.

*Empathize with silence by listening for the feelings and needs behind it.*

Empathy lies in our ability to be present.
> I have witnessed people transcend the paralyzing effects of psychological pain when they have sufficient contact with someone who can hear them empathically.

Our ability to offer empathy can 
+ allow us to stay vulnerable, 
+ defuse potential violence, 
+ hear the word no without taking it as a rejection, 
+ revive a lifeless conversation, and even 
+ hear the feelings and needs expressed through silence.
