## THREE FEEDBACK TRIGGERS

1. Truth Triggers
   - set off by the substance of the feedback itself
   - it’s somehow off, unhelpful, or simply untrue
*How to receive*
  * Separate Appreciation, Coaching, and Evaluation
  * Before you figure out what to do with the feedback, make sure you understand it. ask to clarify.
  * We can’t see ourselves or hear our tone of voice. We need others to help us see ourselves, and our impact on those around us.
2. Relationship Triggers
   - tripped by the particular person who is giving us this gift of feedback.
   - based on what we believe about the giver (they’ve got no credibility on this topic!)
   - or how we feel treated by the giver (after all I’ve done for you, I get this kind of petty criticism?)
*How to receive*
  * Talk about both the feedback and the relationship issues.
  * Step back to see the relationship system between giver and receiver, and the ways you are each contributing to the problems that are prompting you to exchange feedback.
3. Identity Triggers
   - caused our identity—our sense of who we are—to come undone
   - We feel overwhelmed, threatened, ashamed, or off balance. 
*How to receive*
  * Individuals vary widely in our reactions to positive and negative feedback; extreme reactions color our sense of ourselves and our future. 
  * Work to correct distorted thinking and regain balance. 
  * We are always learning and growing. Challenge is the fastest track to growth, especially if we can sort toward coaching.

**Have a growth identity**
>  Inside a growth identity, feedback is valuable information about where one stands now and what to work on next. It is welcome input rather than upsetting verdict.

-----

**APPRECIATION**
> Appreciation is fundamentally about relationship and human connection. At a literal level it says, “thanks.” But appreciation also conveys, “I see you,” “I know how hard you’ve been working,” and “You matter to me.”
> We need evaluation to know where we stand, to set expectations, to feel reassured or secure.
> Three qualities are required for appreciation to count. 
+ it has to be specific
+ appreciation has to come in a form the receiver values and hears clearly.
+ meaningful appreciation has to be authentic
> Most needed by rank and file
> motivates and encourages. 

**COACHING**
> Coaching is aimed at trying to help someone learn, grow, or change. The focus is on helping the person improve, whether it involves a skill, an idea, knowledge, a particular practice, or that person’s appearance or personality.
> Two Needs
 + need to improve your knowledge or skills in order to build capability and meet novel challenges
 + identifying a problem in your relationship: Something is missing, something is wrong.  The “problem” the coaching is aimed at fixing is how the giver is feeling, or a perceived imbalance in the relationship.
> We need coaching to accelerate learning, to focus our time and energy where it really matters, and to keep our relationships healthy and functioning.
>  coaching can also be stressful, confusing, and ineffective
> Needed by people who want to grow their career, managers or equivalent
> helps increase knowledge, skill, capability, growth, or raises feelings in the relationship. 

**EVALUATION**
> Evaluation tells you where you stand. It’s an assessment, ranking, or rating.
> Evaluations are always in some respect comparisons, implicitly or explicitly, against others or against a particular set of standards.
> We need appreciation if all the sweat and tears we put into our jobs and our relationships are going to feel worthwhile.
> Before I can take in coaching or appreciation, I need to know that I’m where I need to be, that this relationship is going to last.
> Needed by those close to failure (PIP)
> Also needed by executives and leadership
> tells you where you stand, aligns expectations, and informs decision making.

## Fixes for Cross-Transactions

**GET ALIGNED: KNOW THE PURPOSE AND DISCUSS IT**
> Discuss the purpose of the feedback explicitly.
(1) What’s my purpose in giving/receiving this feedback?
(2) Is it the right purpose from my point of view?
(3) Is it the right purpose from the other person’s point of view?
> Be explicit about what you think the conversation is about, and be explicit about what would be most helpful to you. Then discuss and, if you each need something different, negotiate. 
> Remember: Explicit disagreement is better than implicit misunderstanding.

**SEPARATE EVALUATION FROM COACHING AND APPRECIATION**
> The evaluation conversation needs to take place first. 
> the evaluation conversation and the coaching conversation should be separated by at least days, and probably longer.
