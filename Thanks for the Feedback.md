## THREE FEEDBACK TRIGGERS

1. Truth Triggers
   - set off by the substance of the feedback itself
   - it’s somehow off, unhelpful, or simply untrue
2. Relationship Triggers
   - tripped by the particular person who is giving us this gift of feedback.
   - based on what we believe about the giver (they’ve got no credibility on this topic!)
   - or how we feel treated by the giver (after all I’ve done for you, I get this kind of petty criticism?)
3. Identity Triggers
   - caused our identity—our sense of who we are—to come undone
   - We feel overwhelmed, threatened, ashamed, or off balance.
