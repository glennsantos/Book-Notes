## THREE FEEDBACK TRIGGERS

1. Truth Triggers
   - set off by the substance of the feedback itself
   - it’s somehow off, unhelpful, or simply untrue
*How to receive*
  * Separate Appreciation, Coaching, and Evaluation
  * Before you figure out what to do with the feedback, make sure you understand it. ask to clarify.
  * We can’t see ourselves or hear our tone of voice. We need others to help us see ourselves, and our impact on those around us.
2. Relationship Triggers
   - tripped by the particular person who is giving us this gift of feedback.
   - based on what we believe about the giver (they’ve got no credibility on this topic!)
   - or how we feel treated by the giver (after all I’ve done for you, I get this kind of petty criticism?)
*How to receive*
  * Talk about both the feedback and the relationship issues.
  * Step back to see the relationship system between giver and receiver, and the ways you are each contributing to the problems that are prompting you to exchange feedback.
3. Identity Triggers
   - caused our identity—our sense of who we are—to come undone
   - We feel overwhelmed, threatened, ashamed, or off balance. 
*How to receive*
  * Individuals vary widely in our reactions to positive and negative feedback; extreme reactions color our sense of ourselves and our future. 
  * Work to correct distorted thinking and regain balance. 
  * We are always learning and growing. Challenge is the fastest track to growth, especially if we can sort toward coaching.

**Have a growth identity**
>  Inside a growth identity, feedback is valuable information about where one stands now and what to work on next. It is welcome input rather than upsetting verdict.
