fear is the enemy
- freezes initiative, 
- ties up creativity, 
- yields compliance instead of commitment

*The presence of fear in an organization is the first sign of weak leadership.*

Progression of psychological safety
1. Inclusion safety
2. Learner safety
3. Contributor safety
4. Challenger safety

Psychological safety is a condition in which you feel 
+ included, 
+ safe to learn, 
+ safe to contribute, and 
+ safe to challenge the status quo—
> all without fear of being embarrassed, marginalized, or punished in some way.
> psychological safety straddles fulfillment, belonging, and security needs

treat human beings as they deserve to be treated—without arbitrary distinctions

**how we feel influences what we think and do.**

psychological safety  as the single most important factor in explaining high performance

psychological safety is high, 
+ people take more ownership and 
+ release more discretionary effort, resulting in 
+ higher-velocity learning and 
+ problem solving.

An organization that expects employees to bring their whole selves to work should engage the whole employee.

As organizations grant increasing levels of respect and permission, individuals generally behave in a way that reflects the level of psychological safety offered to them.

People flourish when they’re participating in a cooperative system with high psychological safety.

## Inclusion safety
> the members of the social collective accept you and grant you a shared identity.
> destigmatized as an outsider and brought into the fold.
> The need to be accepted precedes the need to be heard.

Being ignored is often as painful as being rejected.

Inclusion safety is created and sustained through renewed admittance to the group and repeated indications of acceptance.

Giving inclusion safety is a moral imperative.

## Learner Safety
> Learner safety indicates that you feel safe to engage in the discovery process, ask questions, experiment, and even make mistakes—not if, but when, you make them.

When the environment belittles, demeans, or harshly corrects people in the learning process, learner safety is destroyed.

## Contributor Safety
> Contributor safety is an invitation and an expectation to perform work in an assigned role with appropriate boundaries, on the assumption that you can perform competently in your role.
+ Contributor safety emerges when the individual performs well, but the leader and team must do their part to provide encouragement and appropriate autonomy.

## Challenger Safety
> Challenger safety is a license to innovate.
> the confidence to speak truth to power when you think something needs to change and it’s time to say so.

Only when people feel free and able do they apply their creativity.

If you conduct a postmortem analysis of failure for almost any commercial organization that dies, you can trace the cause of death to a lack of challenger safety.

Where there is no tolerance for candor, there is no constructive dissent. Where there is no constructive dissent, there is no innovation.

To scale innovation throughout the organization, leaders must establish a norm of challenging the status quo.

## paternalism
When a team offers a measure of respect, but very little permission, it falls into the gutter of paternalism. 
> Paternalistic leaders act like helicopter parents and benevolent dictators
> paternalism breeds cynicism and disengagement

permission to contribute, but little respect >> exploitation

act in the role of social architect and nourish a context in which people are given the respect and permission to (1) feel included, (2) learn, (3) contribute, and (4) innovate.
