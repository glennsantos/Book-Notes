fear is the enemy
- freezes initiative, 
- ties up creativity, 
- yields compliance instead of commitment

*The presence of fear in an organization is the first sign of weak leadership.*

Progression of psychological safety
1. Inclusion safety
2. Learner safety
3. Contributor safety
4. Challenger safety

Psychological safety is a condition in which you feel 
+ included, 
+ safe to learn, 
+ safe to contribute, and 
+ safe to challenge the status quo—
> all without fear of being embarrassed, marginalized, or punished in some way.
> psychological safety straddles fulfillment, belonging, and security needs

treat human beings as they deserve to be treated—without arbitrary distinctions

**how we feel influences what we think and do.**

psychological safety  as the single most important factor in explaining high performance

psychological safety is high, 
+ people take more ownership and 
+ release more discretionary effort, resulting in 
+ higher-velocity learning and 
+ problem solving.

An organization that expects employees to bring their whole selves to work should engage the whole employee.

As organizations grant increasing levels of respect and permission, individuals generally behave in a way that reflects the level of psychological safety offered to them.

People flourish when they’re participating in a cooperative system with high psychological safety.

## Inclusion safety
> the members of the social collective accept you and grant you a shared identity.
> destigmatized as an outsider and brought into the fold.
> The need to be accepted precedes the need to be heard.

Being ignored is often as painful as being rejected.

Inclusion safety is created and sustained through renewed admittance to the group and repeated indications of acceptance.

Giving inclusion safety is a moral imperative. 

If there’s no psychological safety, there’s no inclusion.

Including another human being should be an act of prejudgment based on that person’s worth, not an act of judgment based on that person’s worthiness.

create an environment of inclusion before we begin to think about judgments at all.

The only reciprocation requirement in this unwritten social contract is the mutual exchange of respect and permission to belong. 

What should it take to qualify for inclusion safety? Two things: 
1. Be human
2. Be harmless.

To create inclusion safety, it helps to understand cultural differences, but

you don’t need to be an expert in those differences, just sensitive to and appreciative of them.

key drivers of psychological safety include familiarity among team members and the quality of those relationships based on prior interactions.

Inclusion safety is not earned but owed. 

if you’re a leader and want your people to perform, you must internalize the universal truth that people want, need, and deserve validation.

the faster and deeper you get to know each other, the more effectively you can work together.

More contact and context tend to create more empathy.

In any social unit, inclusion safety can be granted, withheld, revoked, or  partially or conditionally granted.

Where there’s no trust, there’s exclusion.

because of our insecurity we refuse to validate each other, which is the very thing that heals the insecurity.

Excluding a person is more often the result of personal unmet needs and insecurities than a genuine dislike of the person.

People with low self-regard have a hard time being inclusive. 
> Research shows that a well-developed sense of personal value and autonomy correlates significantly with kindness, generosity, social cooperation, and a spirit of mutual aid.
> to develop self-regard is to develop your own capacity and confidence and to perform acts of service for others, especially for those whom you struggle to include.
> Make it experiential by creating diverse teams and assigning individuals to diverse mentoring or peer coaching relationships.

As you love people with action, you come to love them with emotion.

## Learner Safety
> Learner safety indicates that you feel safe to engage in the discovery process, ask questions, experiment, and even make mistakes—not if, but when, you make them.

When the environment belittles, demeans, or harshly corrects people in the learning process, learner safety is destroyed.

 three patterns of fear-inducing emotional danger
 1. neglect - schools
 2. manipulation - work 
 3. coercion - work
    * Fear comes as a result of ridicule, bullying, harassment, threats, and intimidation.

the unsafe workplace is most likely a refuge of ridicule.

When the environment punishes rather than teaches, whether through neglect, manipulation, or coercion, individuals become more defensive, less reflective, and less able to self-diagnose, self-coach, and self-correct. That introduces the risk of real failure—the failure to keep trying.

Where learner safety exists, the leader creates a learning process with low social friction and low emotional expense.

 If I’m giving learner safety to an individual, I want and expect the individual to make an effort to learn. If I’m the learner, I expect the leader, teacher, coach, or parent to support me in the learning process.

 we can’t expect the learners to initiate the effort to learn when experience may have taught them that the risk is too great.

 We need to remind ourselves that we don’t command learning, we invite it. 

 In an ideal setting, learner safety is a mutual giving and receiving of ideas, observations, questions, and discussion. 

 We commit to be patient with learners. We commit to model effective learning, and we commit to share power, credit, and resources to enable all to learn.

 That ability to resist making discriminating judgments of students’ abilities is a skill, but it’s also a moral capacity

 Expectations shape behavior in both directions. When you set the bar high or low, people tend to jump high or low.

 I can’t teach students unless I like them. I can’t like them unless I know them, and I can’t know them unless I talk to them.

 Failure isn’t the exception, it’s the expectation and the way forward. There will be discouragement before discovery.

Learner safety requires low ego and uncommonly high emotional intelligence.

A person’s ability to learn requires staying focused, managing impulses, and avoiding distractions.

If you lose emotional engagement, intellectual engagement slows down or may not happen at all. People learn from the people they love more than from the people they don’t.

Humans learn in context, not in isolation
> When the learning context is encouraging, it taps the drive to be curious. 

Grit alone will not close a learning gap. Learner safety is essential.

Either learn and retool to maintain competitiveness or face the grave risk of irrelevance.

an organization as a “system of learning as well as production.”

Leaders must become comfortable portraying themselves as competent through their ability to learn and adapt rather than their expertise.

to cultivate and preserve learner safety:
1. manage those who learn with their mouths—the vocally aggressive members of your team
2. never let hierarchy relieve anyone of the responsibility to learn

Leaders committed to safeguard learner safety understand that learning is where competitive advantage comes from

## Contributor Safety
> Contributor safety is an invitation and an expectation to perform work in an assigned role with appropriate boundaries, on the assumption that you can perform competently in your role.
+ Contributor safety emerges when the individual performs well, but the leader and team must do their part to provide encouragement and appropriate autonomy.

provide autonomy in exchange for performance.
> We will empower you if you can deliver results.

Contributor safety marks the end of the apprenticeship and the beginning of solid, self-directed performance.

the individual invests effort and skill, and the team invests support, guidance, and direction.

 The preparation to perform creates the desire to perform.

The organization is expecting you to carry your load and perform competently.

Organizations engage in only two processes— execution and innovation. Execution is the creation and delivery of value today, while innovation is the creation and delivery of value tomorrow.

Execution is about economizing work and scaling processes.
Innovation is the opposite. It’s about freedom, imagination, creativity, and the introduction of variability. 

Offensive innovation is proactive, while defensive innovation is reactive.
Offensive innovation is a response to an opportunity, while defensive innovation is a response to a threat or crisis.

 The reason defensive innovation is part of contributor safety is that it’s riskier to do nothing than to formulate a response.
>  You seldom feel threatened internally when you’re threatened externally.

The social contract for the third stage of contributor safety trades autonomy for performance.

The social unit grants the individual increased independence and ownership—both know-how and reliability.

When you’re competent and willing to hold yourself accountable, you’re ready to receive contributor safety.

With contributor safety, the organization assumes risk on behalf of the individual, who is expected to contribute.
> We do it gradually based on performance to manage risk along the way.

The Three Levels of Accountability
3. Outcome
2. Process
1. Task

There was guidance, but no handholding, no coddling, and most importantly, no shortcuts.

1. Motivation: Your desire to act
2. Volition: Your power to choose and act for yourself
3. Cognition: The mental process of learning 
4. Emotion: Your state of feeling
5. Apprehension: The state of being conscious or aware of yourself

When a person restricts contributor safety in a way that causes us to freeze our discretionary efforts due to fear and the potential of social and emotional harm, we call that a red zone

when a person grants contributor safety in a way that tends to release discretionary effort, we call that a blue zone 

 Fear-stricken teams give you their hands, some of their head, and none of their heart.

 produce outstanding results in exchange for autonomy, guidance, and support.

 Don’t excuse yourself from the obligation of creating contributor safety because you think you may not possess certain gifts of personality.

 The reality is that whether you’re in a leadership role or an individual contributor role, you have the responsibility to help create contributor safety for the team. Ask yourself if you are emotionally prepared to do it.

 A toxic environment is one in which employees are motivated by personal gain to the point that they engage in mean-spirited comments, unethical behavior, abuse, and bullying.

A toxic environment shuts down performance because people worry about psychological safety before they worry about performance.

Contributor safety results when the individual can contribute, and the leader and team members are able to manage their egos.

To foster the high level of contributor safety needed for a blue zone, you must get to know the members of your team.
> If you want to foster a blue zone of contributor safety, create a truly collaborative environment.

Leaders spend most of their time engaged in inquiry and advocacy.

Track yourself for a day or so and figure out how much of the time you’re telling versus asking. 
> Telling is efficient, but it quickly moves the listener into a passive mode and can slow down learning.

A leader’s tell-to-ask ratio shapes the signal-to-noise ratio for the team. If the leader is telling all the time, that telling becomes noise.

Speaking first when you hold positional power softly censors your team.

to engender contributor safety, help the members of your team think beyond their individual roles.
> requires that we have both the skill and the will to make that bigger contribution.

Before people can get out of their tactical and functional siloes to think strategically, they must be liberated by the contributor safety you give them.

The invitation to think beyond one’s role expresses greater respect for the individual and grants greater permission to contribute.

It’s the leader’s job to recognize the difference between dissenting and derailing behavior and to manage the boundary between the two.
> Those who dissent constructively are guided by a sense of self-awareness and pure intent.



## Challenger Safety
> Challenger safety is a license to innovate.
> the confidence to speak truth to power when you think something needs to change and it’s time to say so.

Only when people feel free and able do they apply their creativity.

If you conduct a postmortem analysis of failure for almost any commercial organization that dies, you can trace the cause of death to a lack of challenger safety.

Where there is no tolerance for candor, there is no constructive dissent. Where there is no constructive dissent, there is no innovation.

To scale innovation throughout the organization, leaders must establish a norm of challenging the status quo.

## paternalism
When a team offers a measure of respect, but very little permission, it falls into the gutter of paternalism. 
> Paternalistic leaders act like helicopter parents and benevolent dictators
> paternalism breeds cynicism and disengagement

permission to contribute, but little respect >> exploitation

act in the role of social architect and nourish a context in which people are given the respect and permission to (1) feel included, (2) learn, (3) contribute, and (4) innovate.
