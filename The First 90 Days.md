major transitions per leader:one every 1.3 years.

Your goal in every transition is to get as rapidly as possible to the break-even point. 
> Takes 6.2 months on average as per surveys

Good initial decisions founded on the right kind of learning, for example, bolster your personal credibility.
> Focus on early wins and alliances

Leadership ultimately is about influence and leverage.

Transition failures happen because new leaders either misunderstand the essential demands of the situation or lack the skill and flexibility to adapt to them.

Transition tasks
1. Prepare yourself. 
> don't stick with what you know
2. Accelerate your learning
> understand product and market
> understand technology
> understand culture
3. Match your strategy to the situation
> A clear diagnosis of the situation is an essential prerequisite for developing your action plan.
4. Secure early wins.
> build personal credibility.
> create value and improve business results
5. Negotiate success.
>  figure out how to build a productive working relationship with your new boss (or bosses) and manage her expectations.
> talk about:
- situation
- expectations
- working style
- resources
- personal development
> agree on 90 day plan
6. Achieve alignment.
> align org structure with strategy
> align processes with strategy
7. Build your team.
> inherited team: restructure, evaluate, mobilize
8. Create coalitions
> identify those whose support is essential for your success, and to figure out how to line them up on your side.
9. Keep your balance.
> preserve your ability to make good judgments.
>  The right advice-and-counsel network is an indispensable resource.
10. Accelerate everyone.
> The quicker you can get your new direct reports up to speed, the more you will help your own performance.

participants in the executive programs we studied reported on average experiencing 2.2 major shifts

----

The starting point for preparing yourself is to understand the types of transitions you’re experiencing.

Decision making becomes more political—less about authority, and more about influence.

One inescapable reality of promotion is that you attract much more attention and a higher level of scrutiny than before.

----

If you’re not thoughtful in adapting to the new situation, you could end up being attacked by the organizational immune system and rejected.

> Not familiar with informal networks of information and communication.
> Not familiar with the corporate culture
> do not have the same credibility
> difficult for some organizations to accept outsiders

Business Orientation
> learning about the company as a whole and not only your specific parts of the business
> thinking beyond simply the financials, products, and strategy
> learn about the brands and products you will be supporting
> understanding the operating model, planning and performance evaluation systems, and talent management systems,

Stakeholder Connection
> identifying key stakeholders 
> building productive working relationships

Expectations Alignment
> check and recheck expectations (what is expected of me and what I actually need to be working on)
> newly hired leaders can easily come to believe that they have more latitude to make changes than is actually the case.
> factor in the expectations of other key constituencies, like finance leaders

Cultural Adaptation
> understand what the culture is overall and how it’s manifested in the organization or unit you’re joining

Culture Checklist
[ ] How do people get support for critical initiatives?
[ ] Is it more important to have the support of a patron within the senior team, or affirmation from your peers and direct reports that your idea is a good one?
[ ] Are meetings filled with dialogue on hard issues, or are they simply forums for publicly ratifying agreements that have been reached in private?
[ ] When it comes time to get things done, which matters more—a deep understanding of processes or knowing the right people?
[ ] Can people talk openly about difficult issues without fear of retribution? Or do they avoid conflict—or, even worse, push it to lower levels, where it can wreak havoc?
[ ] Does the company promote stars, rewarding those who visibly and vocally drive business initiatives? Or does it encourage team players, rewarding those who lead authoritatively but quietly and collaboratively?
[ ] Are there any restrictions on how you achieve results?
[ ] Does the organization have a well-defined, well-communicated set of values that is reinforced through positive and negative incentives?

What are the implications for potential vulnerabilities in your new position?
- cannot balance costs involved in projects
- weaker in creating relationships with leaders
- unable to empathize with customers

to compensate for your vulnerabilities:
> self-discipline, 
> team building, and 
> advice and counsel


----

you can decide to learn and adapt, or you can become brittle and fail.

get good political counsel and personal advice.
> Political counselors help you understand the politics of the organization
> Personal advisers help you keep perspective and equilibrium in times of stress

Take notes, and circulate them back to the boss so that everyone is on the same page.

expect early tests of your authority, and plan to meet them by being firm and fair.
> If you don’t establish limits early, you will live to regret it.

engage with HR and your new boss about creating a 90-day transition plan

----

Planning to learn means figuring out in advance what the important questions are and how you can best answer them.
> create a learning plan

Remember: simply displaying a genuine desire to learn and understand translates into increased credibility and influence.

Leaders who are onboarding into new organizations must therefore focus on learning and adapting to the new culture. 

An 𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 is knowledge that enables you to make better decisions earlier and so helps you quickly reach the break-even point in personal value creation.

Devote some time to defining your learning agenda as early as possible, and return to it periodically to refine and supplement it. 

Sources of knowledge
- Customers
- Suppliers
- Distributors
- Outside analysts
- Frontline R&D and Ops
- Sales
- Procurement
- Customer Service
- Key Staff members
- Integrators / cross functional leaders
- Veterans


One approach is to keep to the same script in all your meetings. 
> have a standard set of questions
> have a standard intro
> ask standard personal info questions to interviewee
- Career so far
- Family life
- What do you want me to know about you?
> ask standard business questions

Initial 1:1 with direct reports
1. Biggest challenge for the team
2. Reason for this challenge
3. Biggest growth opportunity
4. How to harness growth opportunity
5. If you were me, what would you focus attention on?
> Remember to take down notes

Also meet as group to discuss your impressions

The golden rule of transitions is to transition others as you would wish to be transitioned yourself
> go through the same framework as above with them

----

Early wins excite and energize people and build your personal credibility.

you typically will remain in the same job for two to four years before moving on to a new position.

early wins should advance longer-term goals.

Stages of Waves of Change
Stage 1: Transition (1st 30 days)
> Goal: secure early wins
+ build personal credibility
+ establish key relationships
+ identify and harvest low hanging fruit
Stage 2: Immersion (30-60 days)
> Goal: address strategy, structure, systems and skills issues
+ decide which projects to pursue
Stage 3: Reshaping (60-90 days)
Stage 4: Consolidation (90 days and beyond)

Wave phases
1. Learning
2. Designing changes
3. Building support
4. Implementing changes
5. Observing results

Build short-term momentum + ground work for long term goals = early wins

Behavioral Changes > Goals
1. Identify unwanted behaviors
2. Create clear vision of ideal behavior
3. Plan early wins to nudge behavior

Symptoms of bad behaviors

Lack of...
𝗙𝗼𝗰𝘂𝘀
- unclear priorities
- too many priorities
- resources spread thin
- firefighting is rewarded instead of preventing fires

𝗗𝗶𝘀𝗰𝗶𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲
- high variance in performance levels in team members
- team doesn't know negative effects of this variance
- excuses when failing to meet commitments

𝗜𝗻𝗻𝗼𝘃𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻
- performance metrics are internal, not company
- slow improvements
- incremental improvements
- stability is rewarded instead of risk taking

𝗧𝗲𝗮𝗺𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸
- inter team competitiveness
- protect turf vs cooperation
- mine vs ours mentality

𝗦𝗲𝗻𝘀𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝘂𝗿𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆
- ignore needs of customers
- ignore needs of internal customers
- complacent

Basic principles in securing early wins
+ Focus on few promising opportunities. Maybe limit to top 3.
+ Your wins = boss wins. 
+ win the right way, consistent with ethics and culture. maybe something done in the same way as a good behavior you want.
+ Take your STARS portfolio into account. 
+ Adjust for the culture. Should it be public or private.

Watch out for confirmation bias.

Leading former peers
+ Accept that relationships must change. Close personal relationships are rarely compatible with effective supervisory ones.
+ Establish your new role. Get endorsement from higher up, have official announcements posted, etc.
+ Build team, esp good people who were passed for your job.
+ Establish authority deftly. Consult-and-decide for critical issues. Stay informed to make right calls.
+ Focus on good business decisions

Winning credibility
+ Align own values
+ Show right kind of energy
+ Be example of high performance
+ Ask people to be responsible for results
+ But celebrate wins
+ Be accessible but not too familiar
+ Be decisive in low consequence decisions
+ Defer some tougher decisions
+ Encourage input
+ Allow people to achieve results their way
+ Do not burnout people
+ Fire with fairness

Communicate with key people (direct reports, internal customers, etc) your style.
> use manager readme

What messages do you want to get across about who you are and what you represent as a leader?
+ How will you introduce yourself?
+ Will intro 1:1s be informal or immediately down to business?
+ Repair strained external relationships
+ Reduce unnecessary meetings
+ improve work environment problems
+ Focus on learning a lot about the org
+ Take time to intro yourself to people
+ Treat people well and with grace
+ Create teachable moments

Launch early win projects
+ can be finished quickly
+ not costly
+ visible and substantial gains
+ builds up business goals
+ changes org behavior for the better
+ strengthens core areas
+ identify promising people who can lead the project

use FOGLAMP
+ focus (mission)
+ oversight (management of project)
+ goals (smart goal)
+ leadership (leaders)
+ abilities / skills
+ means (resources) 
+ process / frameworks

Plan-then-implement when there is:
+ awareness of the need to change
+ you know what needs to be changed
+ compelling vision exists
+ solid strategy exist
+ ability to plan it properly
+ have support from above

If conditions are not met, first create the ideal condition by collective learning
+ share ideas
+ share research
+ benchmark processes
+ cast vision

Establish new standards of behavior
+ identify good elements
+ elevate and praise those
+ identify bad elements to change
+ know when to use external resources and when to use internal. consultants can be useful for turnarounds

Expose potential problems
+ new trends in public opinion
+ new laws or govt policies
+ changes in market climate
+ economic changes
+ competitor movements (price wars, campaigns, etc)
+ turnover
+ exodus
+ quality problems
+ org silos
+ ivory towers
+ underhand

The higher you climb in organizations, the more you take on the role of organizational architect.

Common pitfalls:
- Making changes for change’s sake.
- Not adjusting for the STARS situation. 
- Trying to restructure your way out of deeper problems
- Creating structures that are too complex. Strive, where possible, for clear lines of accountability.
- Overestimating your organization’s capacity to absorb change

To design (or redesign) your organization, start by thinking of it as an open system.

Elements of Organizational Architecture
𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗶𝗰 𝗱𝗶𝗿𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻. The organization’s mission, vision, and strategy
𝗦𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲. How people are organized in units and how their work is coordinated, measured, and incentivized
𝗖𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀. The systems used to add value through the processing of information and materials. The part that makes money.
𝗦𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝗯𝗮𝘀𝗲𝘀. The capabilities of key groups of people in the organization

Your goal during your first 90 days should be to 
+ identify potential misalignments and 
+ design a plan for correcting them. 

Misalignments between strategic direction and skill bases.
- lack of skill to execute direction

Misalignments between strategic direction and core processes
- processes don't support new direction

Misalignments between structure and processes.
- workflow clashes with reposibilities

Misalignments between structure and skills
- org structure requires new skills
- martix to functional and vice versa

---
1. Begin with strategic direction.
+ are we clear on the direction?
+ how does the unit fit into this direction?

2. Look at supporting structure, processes, and skills.
+ do these things support the direction?
+ how do we align them if not?

3. Decide how and when you will introduce the new strategic direction
+ do we shift direction?
+ what do we change?
+ what timeframe?

4. Think through the correct sequencing. 
+ what actions fit the STARS of the company?
> turnarounds: fix strategy > align structure > fix processes and skills
> realignment: fix processes and skills

5. Close the loop.
+ what is the org's capacity for change
+ what changes are needed still?

Mission: what / what not
Vision: why
Strategy: how

Customers
+ which customers to serve?
+ what value do we bring to them?
+ which markets to enter or exit?

Capital
+ what parts of business need investment / divestment?
+ how much additional capital is required?
+ where will it come from?

Capabilities
+ what are our expertise? 
+ what aren't our expertise?
+ what skills contribute most to strategy?
+ what skills do we still need?

Commitments
+ what resource commitments do we have?
+ which ones can we wind down?

----

𝗖𝗼𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲
+ Use second order thinking to discover potential pitfalls
+ Review mission, vision, strategy
+ Disassemble them into components: markets, products, tech, plans and goals.
+ Does each part support the others?
+ Which parts seem off?

𝗔𝗱𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗮𝗰𝘆
+ What's the plan for the next couple of years?
+ Does the unit goals align with the overall business goals?
+ Does the unit strategy empower the team to succeed? Or does it hinder them?
+ Are there enough resources to accomplish the goals?
+ Will the effort to reach the goal give enough return?
+ Did you use the TOWS / outside-in analysis to determine potential issues?

𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻
+ Are people motivated to pursue the strategy?
+ Are decisions consistent with the direction?
+ Do the actions line up with the goals?
+ Are the performance metrics driving decision making?
+ Are people collaborating?
+ Are people skilled enough?

MODIFY STRATEGIC DIRECTION

If mission, vision and strategy are flawed:
- check STARS
- check your political clout to change the org

much of an organization’s power gets allocated via its structure
> defines authority

ASSESS STRUCTURE

your group’s structure is the way it organizes people and technology to support the mission, vision, and strategy.

𝗨𝗻𝗶𝘁𝘀
+ grouping of direct reports (functional, product, location)
𝗥𝗲𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗿𝗲𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗽𝘀
+ how work is coordinated
𝗗𝗲𝗰𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗿𝘂𝗹𝗲𝘀
+ aligning decisions with strategy, empowering leaders
𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰𝘀

Are the pieces out of tune or in harmony?
- Does the grouping assist the mission?
- Are the reporting relationships aligning effort and accountability?
- Are the decisions made the right way?
- Are we rewarding those who work towards the goals?

Trade offs

𝗦𝗶𝗹𝗼𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗘𝘅𝗰𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲
+ if people have deep expertise, check how well they coordinate with others

𝗗𝗲𝗰𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘀𝗰𝗼𝗽𝗲
+ decisions need to be made by people with the most relevant knowledge, and are incetivized towards decisions that help the org
+ if centralized, can be quick at decisions but uninformed
+ if decentralized, people might not be thinking second order and make unwise calls

𝗪𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲𝘀
+ align the interests of individual decision makers with the interests of the group as a whole
+ balance individual incentives with team incentives

𝗗𝗶𝗳𝗳𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝗔𝗰𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 and Silos
+ top-down are easy to work with but can lead to silos
+ matrix orgs make coordination easier but can lead to pointing fingers


ALIGN CORE PROCESSES

+ If goal if flawless execution, processes should be detailed and documented. Ex manufacturing, service delivery
+ If goal is innovation, outcomes should be well defined with milestones to check progress Ex. software development
+ Rewards should incentivize the correct behaviors without surfacing wrong behaviors.
+ Processes must reinforce each other

Evaluate processes
+ Productivity: is the efficiently transforming knowledge, resources and labor into value?
+ Timeliness: are results delivered on time?
+ Reliability: is the process reliable?
+ Quality: does the process meet quality standards?

To improve a core process
1. Map how the tasks flows through the personnel
2. Ask for the details for each process from the DRI
3. Look for bottlenecks
4. Look for problem nodes, usually hand off points to other teams
5. Solve issues

If responsible for many processes
+ focus on them one at a time
+ factor in org's capacity to change

DEVELOP SKILLS

Knowledge types:
+ Individual expertise / skills
+ Relational knowledge: how teams work
+ Embedded knowledge: data needed to perform well, ex framework documentation
+ Metaknowledge: where to get additional knowledge

To find underutilized resources:
1. Find people / groups who perform better than average
2. Figure out why they were able to do so
3. Find a way to share their knowledge

to change the culture, you need to change the architecture as well as reinforce what you’re trying to do with the right leadership.

----

1. Begin by assessing existing team members
2. devise a plan for getting new people
3. moving the people you retain into the right positions
4. align and motivate your team members to propel them in desired directions
5. establish new processes to promote teamwork

Common Traps
- Criticizing the previous leadership. concentrate on assessing current behavior and results and on making the changes necessary to support improved performance
- Keeping the existing team too long. Kick out weak performers, or define roles.
- Not balancing stability and change. focus only on truly high-priority personnel changes early on
- Not working on organizational alignment and team development in parallel. efforts to assess the organization and achieve alignment should go on in parallel with assessment of the team and necessary personnel changes.
- Not holding on to the good people. look for ways to signal to the top performers that you recognize their capabilities
- Undertaking team building before the core is in place. keep the focus on the business
- Making implementation-dependent decisions too early. defer making decisions until the core members are in place. weigh the benefits of moving quickly on major initiatives against the lost opportunity of gaining buy-in
- Trying to do it all yourself. Find out who can best advise you (HR, boss)

work to align the team with your strategic direction and early-win priorities
- put in place the performance-management and
- decision-making processes

sort out:
- who’s who, 
- what roles people have played, and 
- how the group has worked in the past


𝗘𝘃𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗖𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗮

+ Competence. Skills match role
+ Judgment. Good decisions under pressure
+ Energy. Engaged in work, not burnt out.
+ Focus. Executes based on priorities.
+ Relationships. Gets along with others
+ Trust. Follows through on commitments

Ranking by importance to me
1. Trust *threshold issue
2. Relationships
3. Focus
4. Competence
5. Energy
6. Judgment
- lower criteria can be improved over time

check if people are A-players in the company's current STARS level.

People in critical positions need to be A-players (senior staff, ex)

Evaluation Process
1. Prepare for each meeting.
+ Review available personnel history, performance data, and other appraisals
+ Familiarize yourself with each person’s technical or professional skills
2. Create an interview template
+ Ask people the same set of questions. 
3. Look for verbal and nonverbal clues
4. Assess their judgment.
+ work with a person for an extended time
+ observe if they make sound predictions
+ develop good strategies for avoiding problems
5. Assess team as a whole
+ Read reports and minutes of team meetings, climate or morale surveys of individual units
+ Systematically ask questions.
+ Probe group dynamics

Provisionally assign people to one of the following categories at 90+% confidence 
> Keep in place.
> Keep and develop
> Move to another position
> Replace (low priority)
> Replace (high priority)
> Observe for a while

Replace options:
- Shift role to match skills. Good for keeping things running while looking for a replacement.
- Move away. If problem person has a negative effect.
- Move to another part of org.

Develop backups
+ Evaluate other people on your team and elsewhere in the organization for the potential to move up
+ Use skip-level meetings and regular reporting sessions to evaluate the talent pool
+ Ask human resources to launch a search.

Treat People Respectfully
+ treat people fairly
+ show them that you were thorough in the process

Aligning Your Team
+ breaking down large goals
+ assign responsibility for each element
+ making each individual accountable for managing his goals

Push + Pull for Motivation

Push / Extrinsic
> ex goals, performance systems, incentives
+ motivate via authority, loyalty, fear, or rewards  (carrot / stick)
+ methodical and risk-averse folks, push tools may prove more effective
+ for Turnarounds


Pull / Intrinsic
> vision, team, culture, impact
+ inspire people through hope, positive future, excitement
+ high-energy go-getters may respond more enthusiastically to pull incentives
+ for Realignment

Define Goals and Performance Metrics
> explicit performance metrics is the best way to encourage accountability.
+ Avoid ambiguously defined goals; SMART

Align Incentives

Collective rewards
+ cooperation, teamwork is crucial
+ integration of skills produces output
+ for group tasks

Individual rewards
+ workers are independent
+ high performers usually
+ can be used for independent tasks

The Incentive Equation
> Total Reward = nonmonetary reward + monetary reward
nonmonetary reward: title, recognition
> Monetary reward = fixed compensation + performance-based compensation
> Performance-based compensation = individual + group

The lower the observability or measurability of contributions and the longer the time lag, the more you should rely on fixed compensation.
> ex. R&D = fixed, sales = performance

Articulate Your Vision
+ built on a foundation of intrinsic motivators, such as teamwork and contribution to society.
+ connect people to a larger narrative that provides meaning
+ describe in graphic terms what the organization will achieve and how people will feel to have achieved it
+ Be clear on which elements of your vision are nonnegotiable
+ be flexible enough to consider the ideas of others
+ allow them to have input and to influence the shared vision
+ Develop stories and metaphors to communicate it. stories crystallize core lessons and provide models for the kind of behavior you want to encourage
+ developing communication channels that you will use to spread your vision more broadly.
+ live the vision you articulate
+ Be sure you are prepared to walk the talk.

Leading Your Team

> amiliarize yourself thoroughly with how your

team worked before your arriva

Assess Your Team’s Existing Processes
+ Talk to team members, peers, and your boss about how the team worked
+ Read meeting minutes and team reports
+ Who exerted the most influence on key issues?
+ Find out how each personal react to work
+ How often did your team meet? 
+ Who participated? 
+ Who set the agendas for meetings?
+ Who made what kinds of decisions? 
+ Who was consulted on decisions? 
+ Who was told after decisions were made?
+ How does your predecessor’s leadership style compare with yours?

Processes
+ Do the processes need to change?
+ Determine what specific changes are needed
+ Determine meeting cadence, participant and agenda
+ Determine modes of communication

Lead Decision Making
+ have a framework for understanding and communicating why different decisions will be approached in different ways

Unilateral
- dictatorial
- limited consultation, hence lack of critical information
- lukewarm support

Unanimous
- no closure
- decisions are compromises

𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘀𝘂𝗹𝘁-𝗮𝗻𝗱-𝗗𝗲𝗰𝗶𝗱𝗲
> solicits information and advice from direct reports + reserves the right to make the final call

Use when:
+ the outcome is highly divisive; leader takes the heat
+ has inexperienced team
+ the team needs strong leaders
+ needs to establish authority
+ in Startup phase
+ in Turnaround phase

𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱-𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗲𝗻𝘀𝘂𝘀
> seeks information and analysis + buy-in from the group for any decision; not 100% consensus though, but overwhelming majority

Use when:
+ needs energetic implementation from remote executors
+ has smart and responsible team members
+ in Realignment phase
+ in Sustaining-success phase

consider explaining to your direct reports what process you’re using and why.

they often will support it if:
+ views and interests have been heard and taken seriously
+ have plausible rationale for why you made the call

DON'T build consensus to support decisions after-the-fact

Adjust for Virtual Teams

1. Bring the team together early if at all
2. which communication channels will be used and how they will be employed
3. have explicit agreements concerning responsiveness
4. be more disciplined about capturing and sharing information
5. be more disciplined following up on commitments
6. have rotating note-taker and agenda-creator.
7. provide a lot of structure for virtual team interaction
8.  pause occasionally to recognize and celebrate accomplishments

the break-even point—when the energy the team creates is greater than the energy you need to put into it

----

Start early. 
Discipline yourself to invest in building up “relationship bank accounts” with people you anticipate needing to work with later
> including peers, and those in other departments

**Defining Your Influence Objectives**
1. Think about the alliances you need to build
2. drill down and figure out whose support is essential
3. how you will secure it

Alliance-building plan

1. Identifying influential players

2. Win and Block Alliances
+ winning alliances—the set of people who collectively have the power to support your agenda
+ blocking alliances—those who collectively have the power to say no

3. Map Influence Networks - who influences whom on the issues of concern
   + Influence networks are channels for communication and persuasion that operate in parallel with the formal structure
   + identifying the key points of contact between your organization and others
   + Customers and suppliers, within the business and outside, are natural focal points for alliance building
   + get your boss to connect you to key stakeholders
   + observe carefully in meetings and other interactions to see who defers to whom on crucial issues

sources of power
   * Expertise
   * Control of information
   * Connections to others
   * Access to resources, such as budgets and rewards
   * Personal loyalty

power coalitions: groups of people who explicitly or implicitly cooperate over the long term to pursue certain goals or protect certain privileges

4. Draw Influence Diagrams
   + encircle winning  alliances
   + box blocking alliances
   + draw arrows to show who influences who and how much
   + label status wrt your issue

5. Identify Supporters, Opponents, and Persuadables
   * supporters: build alliances of convenience
        + pushed for similar changes
        + doing small changes on their own
        + new personnel

   * opposition
        + position may be undermined
        + threaten to change established relationships
        + lose face if they cannot adapt to your change
        + change will go against their perceived company values
        + will reward inappropriate behavior (ex consensus seeking vs patronage)
        + threat to power
        + affect allies negatively
    When you meet resistance, probe for the reasons behind it before labeling people as implacably opposed

    * persuadables
        + indifferent - convinced via quid pro quo
        + undecided - convinced via education, persuation
        + uncommitted - convinced via best interests

6. Understanding Pivotal People
+ assess their intrinsic motivators
+ engage them directly in dialogue, ask questions and engage in active listening
+ assess situational pressures: the driving and restraining forces acting on them
+ think about how key people perceive their alternatives or choices
+ convince them that the status quo is no longer a viable option

7. Crafting Influence Strategies
   + **Consultation** promotes buy-in, engaging in active listening
   + **Framing** means carefully crafting your persuasive arguments on a person-by-person basis
        * Logos - persuade via data
        * Ethos - persuade via values, rules
        * Pathos - persuade via emotional appeals
        * Focus and repetition are effective because we learn through repetition
        * inoculate people against counterarguments
  + **Choice-shaping** is about influencing how people perceive their alternatives
  + **Social influence** is the impact of the opinions of others and the rules of the societies in which they live
        * convincing opinion leaders to commit can have a powerful leveraging effect
        * help them remain consistent with: 
            > strongly held internal beliefs
            > prior commitments
            > reputation
        * support their efforts to trigger reciprocity
        * use Incrementalism
            > Getting people involved in shared diagnosis of organizational problems is a form of incrementalism:
            > Once there is agreement on the problem, you can shift to defining the options and then the criteria that will be used to evaluate them

early success in shaping the process can have a big impact on the eventual outcome
   + **Sequencing means** being strategic about the order in which you seek to influence people to build momentum in desired directions
   + **Action-forcing** events get people to stop deferring decisions, delaying, and avoiding commitment of scarce resources >> eliminate inaction as an option

managing yourself is a key transition challenge

1. take stock of how you’re feeling about how things are going in your transition right now
* how do you feel about the move
* what's bothering you about the change
* what do you think you'd do differently

It’s common for leaders to go into a valley three to six months after taking a new role

transitions tend to amplify your weaknesses

potentially dysfunctional behaviors
- pushover: not defining what you are willing and not willing to do
- brittleness: overcommitment to failing courses of action
- isolation: don’t take time to make the right connections, unintentionally discourage people from sharing critical information
- work avoidance: choose to delay by burying yourself in other work. results in tough problems becoming even tougher.

/home/aryeh/Documents/Books/Book Notes/Yerkes-Dodson human performance curve.png
> Pressure is directly correlated to performance, up to a point.

**Pillar 1: Adopt 90-Day Strategies**

+ Prepare yourself. Adopt right mindset
+ Accelerate your learning.
+ Match your strategy to the situation i.e. STARS
+ Negotiate success. Build relationship with boss, build resources
+ Secure early wins. Those that advance long term goals and build momentum
+ Achieve alignment. Fix misalignments of strategy, structure, systems, and skills
+ Build your team. Align team with goals
+ Create alliances. Build support for goals

**Pillar 2: Develop Personal Disciplines**

+ Plan to Plan. devote time daily and weekly to a plan-work-evaluate cycle
+ Focus on the Important. 
+ Judiciously Defer Commitment "Let me think about it and get back to you." Begin with no; it’s easy to say yes later.
+ Go to the Balcony. stand back, take stock from fifty thousand feet, and then make productive interventions
+ Check In with Yourself. engage in structured reflection about your situation. setting aside time each week to assess how things are going.
+ Recognize When to Quit. Work hard at recognizing when you’re at the point of diminishing returns,

**Pillar 3: Build Your Support Systems**

+ Assert Control Locally. set up the office, develop work routines, setup temporary systems
+ Stabilize the Home Front. focus on accelerating the family transition. work through the sense of loss together.
     * Do a support-system inventory, identify priorities, and invest in finding replacements quickly.
     * negotiate up front with your company for job-search support
     * or find such support shortly after moving.
     * Consider waiting until the end of the school year to move your family.
     * be sure that your spouse has extra support to help ease the burden
     * Reestablish familiar family rituals as quickly as possible
     * get professional advice about the cross-cultural transition.
     * Tap into your company’s relocation service, if it has one, as soon as possible. 
+ Build Your Advice-and-Counsel Network. Seek out people who are well connected and whom you can trust to help you grasp what is really going on.
    * get technical advisers: expert analysis on technology, markets
    * get cultural interpreters: understands the cultural norms, mental models, assumptions
    * get political counselors: implement technical advise, deal with political relationships, sounding board
    * get both internal and external advisors.
    * should be skilled at listening and asking questions, have good insight into the way organizations work, and have your best interests at heart.

As you attain higher levels of responsibility, for example, the need for good political counsel typically increases dramatically.

if you can help everyone get up to speed faster, the business will be more nimble and responsive

1. Identify the Critical Transitions
> understand how many transitions are occurring in your organization
> focus first on accelerating the most important
+ leaders at this level should participate in transition workshops within their first 60 days
+ know what the mix is
+ tailor the support you’re providing
+ focus on critical transitions
+ may need to address culture change

2. Diagnose Existing Transition Support

**designing a companywide acceleration system**
    1. assess the status of your company’s existing acceleration support frameworks and tools.
    2. Examine the approaches your organization currently uses to deliver transition support 
    3. Evaluate the associated costs and benefits
    4. Assess the overall coherence of your organization’s approach
    5. Identify the key stakeholders
    6. Assess the adequacy of your company’s HR information systems

3. Adopt a Common Core Model

Can freely discuss
> STARS portfolio of challenges
> technical, cultural, and political learnings
> key elements of their learning plan
> progress in the five conversations
> agreed-upon priorities and plans to secure early wins
> alliances they need to build

+ conversations will happen that wouldn’t have happened otherwise. 
+ more likely to share confidences and information
+ more tolerant of others’ transition struggles

4. Deliver Support Just in Time
+ Early on, support for accelerating learning—technical, cultural, and political—is key
+ As the leader’s understanding grows, the focus of support should shift to helping him define strategic direction
+ leaders need to be offered transition support in digestible blocks
+ providing them with key documents and tools that help them plan their early diagnostic activities
+ helping them connect with key stakeholders as early as possible.
+ have transition coaches engage in preentry diagnosis

Acceleration systems should therefore be designed to help new leaders get the maximum possible benefit from whatever preentry time is available to them.

5. Use Structured Processes
> transition processes also need to have action-forcing events
+ create a series of focused events

6. Match Support to Transition Type
> Promotion
+ understand what success looks like at the new level, 
+ assess themselves, and 
+ create a personal development plan.
> Onboarding
+ helping them understand what it takes to get things done
+ assistance in identifying and connecting with key stakeholders 

7. Match Transition Support to Leader Level
> makes sense to provide them with transition coaching
> a thorough knowledge of the organization and its culture is a prerequisite for effectiveness
+ identify alternative modes for delivering transition support
+ assess the relative costs and benefits of the support
+ match its delivery mode and extent to key levels in the company’s leadership pipeline

8. Clarify Roles and Align Incentives
> Transition support is a team sport.
+ allow bosses and other key players to be highly focused and efficient in supporting their new direct reports
+ HR generalists helping them navigate the new culture.

9. Integrate with Other Talent Management Systems
> integrate recruiting and onboarding
- hiring people because they have a needed set of capabilities and not paying enough attention to fit
- be thoughtful about the trade-offs between individual capabilities and cultural fit
