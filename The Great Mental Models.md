## The Map is not the Territory

Maps are:
- reductions of what they represent
- a snapshot of a point in time
- subjective to the author's point of view

> the only way we can navigate the complexity of reality is through some sort of abstraction

if the aim becomes simplification rather than understanding we start to make bad decisions.

They are guidebooks, not laws.

1. Reality is the ultimate update.
> If reality has changed, the map must change.
> The faster the rate of change in the territory, the harder it will be for a map to keep up to date.
2. Consider the cartographer.
> Maps are not purely objective creations. They reflect the values, standards, and limitations of their creators.
> Models, then, are most useful when we consider them in the context they were created.
3. Maps can influence territories.
> As more and more people know what model youâ€™re using to manipulate them, they may decide not to respond to your incentives.
