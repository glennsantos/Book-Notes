## The Map is not the Territory

Maps are:
- reductions of what they represent
- a snapshot of a point in time
- subjective to the author's point of view

> the only way we can navigate the complexity of reality is through some sort of abstraction

if the aim becomes simplification rather than understanding we start to make bad decisions.

They are guidebooks, not laws.

1. Reality is the ultimate update.
> If reality has changed, the map must change.
> The faster the rate of change in the territory, the harder it will be for a map to keep up to date.
2. Consider the cartographer.
> Maps are not purely objective creations. They reflect the values, standards, and limitations of their creators.
> Models, then, are most useful when we consider them in the context they were created.
3. Maps can influence territories.
> As more and more people know what model you’re using to manipulate them, they may decide not to respond to your incentives.

## Circle of Competence

Understanding your circle of competence improves decision-making and outcomes.

In circle of competence:
* likely have more than one solution to every problem
* eliminate bad choices quickly because he has all the pieces of the puzzle
* make decisions quickly and relatively accurately.
* know what is knowable and what is unknowable and can distinguish between the two.

Building a circle of competence takes years of experience, of making mistakes, and of actively seeking out better methods of practice and thought.

To maintain the circle:
1. curiosity and a desire to learn. Learning comes when experience meets reflection.
2. self-reporting. monitor honestly so the feedback can be used to your advantage. 
   * Keeping a journal of your own performance is the easiest and most private way to give self-feedback. 
3. external feedback. 

Coaching benefit
- receive something you couldn’t see himself and something no one else would point out: knowledge of where his skill and technique was suboptimal.
- ability to provide better feedback to other doctors.

if defensiveness starts to manifest, focus on the result you hope to achieve.

successfully operating outside a circle of competence
1. Learn at least the basics
2. Talk to someone whose circle of competence in the area is strong.
   * Ask thoughtful questions
3. Use a broad understanding of the basic mental models to augment your limited understanding

### Falsifiability

Falsification is the opposite of verification
> you must try to show the theory is incorrect, and if you fail to do so, you actually strengthen it.

Applying the filter of falsifiability helps us sort through which theories are more robust.
